## How to Use AI Music Generator
Creating professional music with AI Music Generator is a streamlined process, broken down into four simple steps that require no prior musical experience:

### Step 1: Select Your Style
Start by choosing your preferred music genre—options include pop, rock, electronic, hip-hop, classical, jazz, cinematic, ambient, and over 50 others. Next, define the mood and atmosphere of your track (e.g., uplifting, emotional, epic, melodic) to guide the AI’s composition. This step ensures the AI aligns its output with your creative vision from the start.

### Step 2: Input Your Ideas
Communicate your vision to the AI by describing key details: specify the tempo, desired instruments (e.g., piano, drums, guitar, synths), or even hum a melody if you have one in mind. The more specific you are—whether mentioning a particular artist’s style, a scene you’re scoring, or a feeling you want to evoke—the more tailored the AI’s output will be. This flexibility makes the tool accessible to both those with clear ideas and those seeking inspiration.

### Step 3: AI Creates & You Refine
Once you’ve provided your input, the AI generates a draft track in seconds. You can then refine the music to perfection: edit the melody, rearrange sections, adjust the mix, or regenerate parts that don’t align with your vision. The platform’s instant audio preview feature lets you hear changes in real time directly in your browser, making the refinement process intuitive and efficient.

### Step 4: Export & Publish
When you’re satisfied with your track, export it in high-quality formats like MP3, WAV, or FLAC. For advanced users, the platform also offers separate stems for further mixing and production. You can then share your music on any platform—Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, TikTok, podcasts, or indie game soundtracks—with full commercial rights to monetize your work.

## Key Features & Advantages
AI Music Generator stands out from other music AI tools thanks to its robust feature set and user-centric design:

### Studio-Grade Audio Quality
The tool delivers professional, polished tracks that meet industry standards.
